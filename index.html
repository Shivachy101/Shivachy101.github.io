        <p> France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European nations. It plays an influential global role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-7, the G-20, the EU, and other multilateral organizations. France rejoined NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009, reversing DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely parliamentary administrations. In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century, five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper. </p>
        <p>Why one wants to include a body on their web page:The body tag holds the “meat” of your web page, and will include your page’s content. It holds all of your div, img, p, etc tags. Commonly, people also insert styles and stylesheet or javascript references in the body instead of the head. </p>
        <p>Why one wants to include !DOCTYPE html in their web page: The doctype tag should always be placed at the beginning of the source code of HTML documents and sub-pages. Thanks to DOCTYPE, you can tell at first glance what type of document you’re dealing with. If the declaration is missing in the document, it can lead to errors in how your website is displayed.</p>
       
    <h2>Some info about headers</h2>
    <p>The importance of headers: HTML headers play a pivotal role in structuring web content and enhancing its accessibility. They not only provide a hierarchy to your content but also improve the overall user experience. </p>

    


    <h2>Why validate your code ?</h2>
    <p>Here is one reason , W3C validation is the process of checking a website's code to determine if it follows the formatting standards. If you fail to validate your website's pages based on W3C standards, your website will most likely suffer from errors or poor traffic owing to poor formatting and readability.</p>
